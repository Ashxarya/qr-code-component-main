## My process

This project was fairly straightforward, i used html to place down 3 elements (an image, an h1 and a p element) into a div. From there CSS was used to style the rest. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to make a very basic card and how to center and size different elements inside said card.
I also learned how to add box shadows.
I figured out how to deploy builds onto netlify through github.

### Continued development

I would like to continue focussing on flexbox and grid to understand how to organize and align elements in different sections better.

  I used this video to understand how to place colours into the beggining of CSS using root, and how to make and organize cards in general.
